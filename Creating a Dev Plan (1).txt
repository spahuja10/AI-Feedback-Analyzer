[Speaker 1] (0:02 - 1:45)
Hi, everybody. This is I'm going to do a video for you on how to fill out a development plan. Actually, as you see here, I call action plan, but I'm going to change that.

I like development plan better. And I'm also I'm here with Harvey. Harvey is Harvey Beldner, and he is going to be the person that I'm going to write this development plan with.

So we are at the exact point where you are now where you have provided the feedback, you've talked about areas of strength and areas of development. But but first of all, before we get going, Harvey, thank you so much for being here. Thanks for having me.

Really appreciate it. Thank you for being like the guinea pig here. I appreciate that too.

And just FYI, Harvey is the first speaker when we get to the advanced course, his topic is on growth mindset and very, very good topic, really good session. And I look forward to that. And so yeah, so here we go.

All right. So let's go into the roleplay mode. Ready?

Right. Okay. All right, Harvey, thank you so much for for going through the data with me.

That was a good session. And what we came up with, I put I typed this into the development plan for you. But what we came up with was generally the feedback that you got.

And there was a feedback was a combination of the 360 and the personality assessment. We talked about areas of strength and areas of development. So I went ahead and I typed these in for the audience for the students, by the way, you don't need to fill this in, you can do this during the session, totally up to you what you want to do.

Definitely go ahead and put the feedback that was a combination of the 360 and the personality assessment here in this block, I'm sure you're gonna have to condense that you could just use keywords, and that's fine. But if you want to, you can put the strengths and areas of development. Okay, so now we're back to that.

[Speaker 2] (1:46 - 1:57)
And I think it was great, you know, to have a working model really, that synthesized sort of how you see me and how you saw me from the 360 feedback, it was a good starting point and good to be reflective about it.

[Speaker 1] (1:57 - 2:02)
That's awesome. Thank you. Is there anything on here that you would change given the conversation we had?

[Speaker 2] (2:04 - 2:24)
Oh, I think it sums it up pretty well. You know, of course, like a lot of people, I go to the development areas, you know, where I may be falling short either in, you know, the way people see me or what my development goals are. It's, you know, it's natural.

It's sort of how I critique myself. And it's where I want to where I want to talk.

[Speaker 1] (2:25 - 2:50)
Yeah, yeah. When I look back through these, I look at this, and this is really good stuff. I mean, when if you look at what the feedback said, you know, things like strong work ethic, or great with clients, and those are so important to your job, that this is really a good group.

Now, I think we could probably fill this out for pages and pages and pages. But what I captured really were the key messages.

[Speaker 3] (2:51 - 2:51)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (2:51 - 3:01)
And same thing over here with areas of strength, I could have added, we could have gone on and on and on about those. But what's important is to get really the key messages of what you want. Yeah.

[Speaker 2] (3:01 - 3:11)
And you can't overdo it, right? I mean, I can work on a few things at a point in time. So it's good to sort of keep it to the either to the critical view or the most important ones.

[Speaker 1] (3:12 - 3:39)
Yeah, exactly. Okay. So now that we've done this, we've given the you've had the feedback, we've had good conversations about it, what we want to do is identify what are some development goals as a result of this.

And then we also want to write the how are you going to complete those? How are you going to go about those development in terms of the action items you're going to take? So when you look at this, what do you think some development goals would be that that you're interested in working on?

[Speaker 2] (3:40 - 3:45)
You know, I think a couple of things come to my mind, Marcia. By the way, you are Marcia, right?

[Speaker 1] (3:46 - 3:46)
I am Marcia.

[Speaker 2] (3:47 - 5:20)
Dr. King, Dr. King, getting, getting, you know, of course, I think the feedback that I can work people a little bit too hard, I could be a little too overbearing, you know, reflects in my mind, but also maybe with where I am in life and in my career, and I would like to start thinking about myself. And I'd like for other people to start thinking about me as someone who is maybe a teacher, you know, you know, somebody who is imparting knowledge and helping people to do their job better. And I always wanted to be someone who helps people do their jobs better.

But maybe I'm being more thoughtful and reflective about, you know, maybe that's my contribution to the organization. Maybe that's a way I want to see myself and reframe how I work. And that, you know, I'm teaching people.

And maybe that also sort of affects sort of the patients I have or don't have when I'm working with others. Yeah, it's being when I'm working with folks in the hopes of developing them and helping them learn. So I think my goals are, yeah, to be more of a teacher and a coach.

To let people shine and let people learn on the job. And listen, I still have, I think a lot of gas left in my tank, I, you know, I do want to sort of be seen as an organizational leader who can continue to progress in the company. And I think addressing those development areas, and that feedback from the 360 is important to doing that, or being able to do that.

[Speaker 1] (5:23 - 5:46)
Okay, I don't know if I need to put that. So, so here's what I captured. So, so far, it's really shift your management style to that as more of a teacher or coach.

And then also to be seen as an organizational leader, I think you're already seen as an organizational leader. So let's be more descript on that one. You kind of went down that path, but I didn't capture it.

So what kind of an organizational leader do you want to be seen as?

[Speaker 2] (5:47 - 6:21)
You know, I think it's two things, Marcia, I think it's being able to set the strategy, and not sort of talk about some things and then do them, you know, it's sort of set a strategy and a vision, and then rely on my team or help my team to make that a reality. So I think it blends, you know, all those areas of development is getting out of the tactics too often. And being a little bit too tough on the folks that are that are on my team.

Yeah, rely on my team. Yep. It's, I think it's doing and not dinging.

[Speaker 1] (6:22 - 6:27)
Ding my team. How about that? Okay.

So what do you think about these three development goals?

[Speaker 2] (6:29 - 6:36)
I think my reaction is it's good. You know, is it too much, Marcia? Is it too much to sort of jam into my overall goals?

[Speaker 1] (6:37 - 7:00)
I don't. So I don't think so. Because really, number two, and three are supportive of number one.

So there are sub goals. If you're doing, if you're shifting your management style to that of teacher coach, you're naturally going to be relying on your team more. So those go.

The strategic leader, I don't know anyone on the planet who doesn't need to have that on their development plan. We just can't be strategic enough.

[Speaker 2] (7:01 - 7:01)
It's the world we're in.

[Speaker 1] (7:02 - 7:16)
Yeah, it is. Actually, I think that the shifting your, your management style to that of more coaching and teaching that is strategic. So again, I think that these support each other pretty well.

I would keep all three. How do you feel about that?

[Speaker 2] (7:17 - 7:19)
I'm good. I feel good about it.

[Speaker 1] (7:19 - 7:45)
All right, then let's come up with some action items. And so these are, if you do these, you should accomplish these, or at least it gives you more of an opportunity to like, here's an example, an action item would be something like identify a mentor, who's really good at strategic thinking, who's a great strategic leader who can give you modeling advice, coaching. So that that's an example of what I'm talking about.

[Speaker 2] (7:45 - 8:00)
Yeah. Do you think that's a good one, Marcia? You know, I was going towards more of the on the job stuff.

But you know, you think about sort of what's what's a powerful development action is, is that, you know, would that be in your opinion, one of the most bang for the buck action items?

[Speaker 1] (8:01 - 8:27)
I think so. I mean, that every everybody, every senior leader, everybody, not just senior people, benefits from having a mentor. Yeah, I see this as somebody, you know, so it'll serve several purposes.

But the first one is for modeling. So you can actually identify somebody who's really good at this. But the second one is somebody who's been there done that tried everything has been successful has failed can give you great advice.

[Speaker 3] (8:27 - 8:28)
Right?

[Speaker 1] (8:28 - 8:33)
I went to and then the third thing, I think a mentor does for you is that they become an advocate.

[Speaker 2] (8:33 - 8:33)
Right?

[Speaker 1] (8:34 - 8:35)
Yeah. Who doesn't need that?

[Speaker 2] (8:36 - 8:36)
Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (8:36 - 8:48)
Okay. I safely put then identify an internal. Yeah, I'm kind of torn on that.

I think internal is best because it's going to that person's going to understand your business like no one else.

[Speaker 2] (8:49 - 8:50)
Right? Right.

[Speaker 1] (8:51 - 8:51)
Keeping it.

[Speaker 2] (8:52 - 9:02)
Yeah, I think it should be. And then to your point about advocacy. I mean, obviously, having an advocate inside of the company is going to be more powerful than somebody who's outside and not as influential.

[Speaker 1] (9:03 - 9:32)
Yeah. Okay, so I'm writing these words on here, obviously, but I'm going to hand it over to you when I'm done. And you can wordsmith it.

You can add, change, delete, you can throw it away if you want to. I think it's going to be good. Alright, so so you started to go down a different pathway, though, about on the job stuff.

So let's talk. Are there any on the job experiences that will help you to succeed at these goals?

[Speaker 2] (9:32 - 9:58)
You know, it's funny, it might not be an on the job experience so much as it might be sort of maybe giving my team permission to call me out, you know, I want my team to know what I'm aspiring to, I want my team to know that a, I'm very invested in their future and their development and their capabilities. And that's sort of the genuine place from where all my behavior comes.

[Speaker 3] (9:58 - 9:58)
Yeah.

[Speaker 2] (9:59 - 10:25)
But if it's too much, or if they feel like I'm getting too into the weeds too tactical or being too hard on them, can I give them the permission in a comfortable and safe way that they feel genuinely say, hey, you know, don't be so overbearing, right? I'm not sure what trigger I would give them. And maybe we come up with that together.

But I want to give them permission to say, back off, I got it, or maybe more or more or less hard.

[Speaker 1] (10:27 - 10:48)
So let me so I like this, I think it's good. And I think we should keep it. But I want you to keep in mind that, you know, the feedback already came back that you can be overbearing.

And so do you giving them permission? I don't know if that would work, because you've got positional power. And I don't know, they may be they may be too intimidated to call you out.

[Speaker 2] (10:48 - 10:58)
You know, when you say that, it makes me a little bit sad, you know, that they wouldn't feel comfortable to do that. But I get it. Yes.

You know, clearly, they didn't feel comfortable telling me and they felt comfortable telling you.

[Speaker 1] (10:59 - 11:39)
Yeah. So yeah. And I think there's two things at play there.

One, again, positional power, and that has really nothing to do with you. It's the position. So most people have a hard time calling out someone more senior than them.

And that's actually normal. But then the second one is that you did receive the feedback that you can be overbearing. And so, and I don't know if that has to be really negative, or, you know, when I collected the feedback, and I shared with this with you already, when we went through the feedback, is that it's kind of like a larger than life personality.

So overbearing is probably the wrong word. overshadowing, actually, it might be a better word.

[Speaker 2] (11:40 - 12:19)
Okay, well, that would drive me to act differently, actually, Marsha, to that point. I mean, yeah, how do I consciously step back? And maybe what it is, is, again, I'm just sticking out loud with you is, do I have my team members go out and represent me more rather than sort of me being there?

And, you know, you know, giving them the space and the stage, if that's the right word to, to go out and interact, and I could help them prepare, you know, and that's sort of the teaching side, but that they go out and do so they're not sort of under, under that shadow or, or overshadowed by it.

[Speaker 1] (12:20 - 12:25)
Okay, so have people, your team represent you without your involvement?

[Speaker 2] (12:26 - 12:31)
Well, you made me a little bit uncomfortable there. I think it's, I would like to help them prepare.

[Speaker 1] (12:32 - 12:33)
Okay.

[Speaker 2] (12:33 - 12:40)
Maybe that's too controlling. But I think sort of my benefit for them is to help them prepare for those types of situations. Fair or unfair?

[Speaker 1] (12:41 - 12:54)
Yeah. What if we said this? What about you'll help them prepare in the, with the expectation that, you know, you're going to do it one or two times.

And when they're ready to do it on their own, you'll let go and really step back?

[Speaker 2] (12:55 - 12:57)
Absolutely. Yep.

[Speaker 1] (12:57 - 13:04)
Okay, so and so I will help them to prepare until I feel they are completely ready.

[Speaker 2] (13:04 - 13:06)
Until I feel or until they feel, Marsha.

[Speaker 1] (13:07 - 13:35)
Oh, that's a good point. Until they feel I like that so much better. Because if we do it when you feel comfortable, that might never, I may never feel that good.

Okay. I will help them to prepare until they feel they are completely ready to go solo. Does that make sense?

Yeah. Okay. All right.

So when I look at these identifying a mentor, okay, this is specific, specifically about strategic thinking.

[Speaker 2] (13:35 - 13:40)
Who can help me work on that? Right? Okay.

[Speaker 1] (13:40 - 14:31)
So number one gets to number two. All right. Permission to call me out particularly when I'm I thought we were gonna I thought we decided to kill that ultimately.

Okay, good. Because I don't like that one. I just don't like it doesn't feel right.

Okay, so then find opportunities to have my team represent me, blah, blah, blah, blah. That covers both of these. I like that a ton.

Okay. Do you want to add anything extra about shifting to more of a coaching? What about I don't know, I was trying to think about how do you develop your own coaching slash teaching skills?

Is there a way that you can do that? So that you're prepared to do number one, asking you to shift your management style to be more teaching and coaching. That sounds nice.

But how are you going to make that shift? That's what I'm trying.

[Speaker 2] (14:31 - 14:36)
Yeah. I mean, are you suggesting like something formal Allah a book or?

[Speaker 1] (14:37 - 14:43)
Yeah, I mean, we could start with that. If I remember correctly from your assessment, you actually do like to read.

[Speaker 2] (14:44 - 14:45)
I like to listen more. Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (14:46 - 15:04)
All right. So why don't we? How about we just identify a learning opportunity that is going to stretch your teaching and coaching skills.

That way, you can kind of start looking for it now and identify one that works best for you.

[Speaker 2] (15:05 - 15:10)
You know that just write it down. But as you said it, it sounds and feels kind of wooly to me.

[Speaker 1] (15:10 - 15:17)
I know. I totally agree with you. It's like, okay, there's no and also there's like no sense of urgency.

There's right. No timeline.

[Speaker 2] (15:18 - 15:19)
You'll find something. Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (15:19 - 15:31)
Yeah, exactly. So how about I know what? What about do you have any peers that you think are good at this that may have done something?

[Speaker 2] (15:32 - 15:57)
You know, I like that. Yeah, I like that. Yes.

Find out, you know, someone who's done that. Well. Yeah, I like that.

Find somebody who does that. Well, and you know, it's separate from the mentor. It's a little bit more tactical, I guess.

But it is. How do you how do you make that shift? Or how did you make that shift from leader to teacher or from manager to to teacher?

[Speaker 1] (15:58 - 16:10)
Okay. Okay. So did they shift from?

Okay, I think we've captured here. So ask my peers what they have done to shift their own management style to be more teaching slash coaching.

[Speaker 2] (16:12 - 16:32)
I feel it still feels a little bit weak, but well, let's, let's add, let's add something to that, which is maybe, you know, define what that process is to me. You know, okay, how do I tease someone up to learn something new? Practice it and do it.

[Speaker 1] (16:32 - 16:35)
Okay, so define the define that process. What was the second piece?

[Speaker 2] (16:37 - 16:50)
Define the process to help someone learn something new. And how I will support them as you're doing it without being overbearing.

[Speaker 1] (16:52 - 16:56)
Without I'm gonna put that. How about I say without overshadowing?

[Speaker 2] (16:57 - 16:57)
Yep.

[Speaker 1] (17:01 - 17:02)
Okay, now what do you think?

[Speaker 2] (17:03 - 17:48)
Can you do me a favor and scroll down a little bit so I could see both the goals and the and the actions. Okay, yeah, thank you. Listen, I like it.

It feels right. I think they're interrelated that the action items are interrelated to the goals. Good.

I do think to your point, you know, these should be smarter, quote, unquote, you know, yeah, what I'm going to do and when I'm going to say continue working on development plan to make it more smarter, smarter, smarter and stuff, smarter and stuff.

[Speaker 1] (17:53 - 18:11)
I think it's a great start. Yeah, it's a great start. So what we'll do is that we will continue this document is going to continue evolving.

I mean, it's never do you create a development plan that's stays the same. It's a dynamic document. So we'll continue looking at this.

But I think it's a really good place to start.

[Speaker 2] (18:11 - 18:31)
Yeah, thank you. Hey, so but really me this Dr. King, like, is there a feedback mechanism that we should build in here? Like, that's a great point.

Go back to people. If they're not, you know, doing a positional authority comfortable to say I'm doing a horrible job. Would they tell you how I'm doing?

[Speaker 1] (18:31 - 18:35)
How about request? How about request a 360 at least annually?

[Speaker 2] (18:36 - 18:43)
But annual is, you know, annually seems so far away. I'd like to know if I'm making progress sooner rather than later.

[Speaker 1] (18:44 - 18:47)
Could you get that through 360? Because this is kind of what I've already done.

[Speaker 2] (18:48 - 18:56)
I, I think maybe it's not 360. But it's it is there a mechanism for us to go back and collect feedback about how I'm doing?

[Speaker 1] (18:57 - 19:02)
Okay. What do you think? What could you do?

[Speaker 2] (19:06 - 19:13)
I mean, I was sort of attracted to the idea of you doing it only because you've gotten the feedback before they've shared it with you.

[Speaker 1] (19:17 - 19:24)
So I how about I collect feedback as a follow up to the 360.

[Speaker 2] (19:25 - 19:50)
Perfect. Okay. And by the way, you know, unless you tell me I'm crazy, you know, I would like to share that these are my goals with my team.

So they also know what I'm working on. It shows a little bit of vulnerability on my part. But it also, you know, if somebody feels bold enough, you know, could empower somebody to say, you know, here's a little bit of feedback on how you're doing, buddy.

[Speaker 1] (19:52 - 20:06)
I think that's fantastic. So okay, so click feedback as part of right what so basically, the question I'm going to say is what questions have I'm sorry, what changes have you seen? And given what you just said, you want me to add another piece to this?

[Speaker 2] (20:08 - 20:29)
You know what, I think I could just sort of share with the team that I'm doing this what I'm working on, you know, at some point, they need to have their feedback acknowledged as well, right? So hey, I got the feedback. Thank you.

And here's what I'm doing. I'm going to feel comfortable enough. I welcome your feedback formally, informally, at any point in time you have it.

[Speaker 1] (20:30 - 21:13)
Okay, I'm going to say follow up with feedback providers to demonstrate how serious you are, but I don't like that phrase to demonstrate commitment. Oh, yeah, there you go. And yeah, I think that's enough.

Follow up with feedback providers to demonstrate commitment to, to learning and growth, to learning growth, and to thank them for their contributions. How do you like that?

[Speaker 2] (21:14 - 21:15)
That's great. Okay.

[Speaker 1] (21:16 - 21:17)
All right.

[Speaker 2] (21:17 - 21:19)
I think six is a lot.

[Speaker 1] (21:19 - 21:28)
But it's a lot. It is. But kind of like, um, this is a given you're going to do that anyway, we could, it's right.

[Speaker 2] (21:29 - 21:30)
Yeah, it's evolving it. Yeah.

[Speaker 1] (21:31 - 21:46)
I think this is you can add number six, you can add to forums that are already in place. Yeah, like, that's going to add stuff to your calendar. You can also just get during number six, you can give them a heads up that number five is going to happen.

[Speaker 2] (21:47 - 21:49)
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you're right. You can validate it nicely.

[Speaker 1] (21:50 - 22:20)
Yeah. So let's see here. Ask some of your peers.

I mean, that could be during lunch. So that I don't, I wouldn't go I wouldn't over engineer this. Yeah, this is going to be more time consuming, because you're going to have to spend time with a mentor.

I don't know if this is going to be a whole lot of time. I'm not sure. But you know what, we will pay attention to that.

Because it's it's legitimate, you don't want to ever create a development plan that someone can't achieve. So I think that these are achievable.

[Speaker 2] (22:20 - 22:37)
Do you I I do. I do think number two is the meatiest of them all, though, Marsha, which is sort of building the capability of my team, and doing it in a way that feels like a learning experience, or at least they don't feel abused in the process. They feel like I'm actively trying to help them grow and get better.

[Speaker 1] (22:38 - 22:51)
I totally agree. And you know, like, if I had to, we could rank order these, I would say number two should be number one. I think number one should be number two.

What do you think? Yeah, I agree.

[Speaker 2] (22:51 - 22:51)
Yep.

[Speaker 1] (22:52 - 23:02)
And I think number three seems well placed. Yeah, I think the follow up with your team with all the people gave feedback should be fourth.

[Speaker 2] (23:07 - 23:16)
You know, we could probably just take off number five, actually. And I wonder even if this format should should sort of lend itself to being smart and stuff.

[Speaker 1] (23:16 - 23:26)
Yeah, I agree. Agree. We don't actually have to put that in the development plan.

And basically, in other words, is that we're going to revisit this and constantly make it better.

[Speaker 3] (23:27 - 23:28)
Good.

[Speaker 1] (23:30 - 23:35)
All right, I think we're done for now. But we'll definitely be revisiting this.

[Speaker 2] (23:36 - 23:37)
You'll save this and send it to me.

[Speaker 1] (23:38 - 23:40)
Give me five minutes.
